Arnab has given me a challenge.I have to calculate the number of numbers which are less than a certain value n,and have exactly k set bits in its binary form.As you are a
Prepster like me,help me write a code that will take input for n and k and give the expected output.
Input format:
   First line containing n and k space separated.
Output format:
   Number of numbers present in a single line
Sample Input
   72
Sample Output
   3
Constraints:
1<=n<=10000
1<=k<=10


import java.util.*;
public class countNumberWith_k_SetBit {
	public static void main(String [] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n,k;
		System.out.println("Enter the value of n:");
		n = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Enter the value of  k:");
		k = sc.nextInt();
		int temp = 1,count = 0;

		while(temp < n) {
			int tt = temp,cnt = 0;
			while(tt > 0) {
				int bit = tt & 1;
				if(bit == 1) {
					cnt++;
				}
				tt = tt >> 1;
			}
			if(cnt == k) {
				count++;
			}
			temp++;
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}
