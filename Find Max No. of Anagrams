The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of elements in A.
• Each line i of the N subsequent lines (where 0 <= 1 < N ) contains a string describing A[i].

Sample Testcases

    Input                                   Output          Output Description
abc bca cdf                                    2                Here "abc" and "bca" are anagrams of each other. Hence, the maximum number of strings we can choose is 2.
"abc","def","ghi"                              1                There are no two strings which are anagrams of each other. Hence, there is only 1 string we can choose.
"abcd" "abcd", "dcba", "pqrs", "rqsp"          3                "abcd", "abcd" and "dcba" these 3 strings are anagrams of each other. Hence, here we can choose 3 strings.



def maxAnagrams(N, A):
    # Write your code here
    cnt = 1
    for i in range(0,N) :
        A[i] = sorted(A[i])
    cnt = 1
    for i in range (0,N):
        cur = 1
        for j in range (i+1,N):
            if A[i] == A[j]:
                cur += 1
                cnt = max(cur,cnt)
    return cnt
