Every decimal number can be changed into its binary form.Suppose your computer has it's own Corona Virus,that eats binary digits from the right side of a number.
Suppose a virus has 6 spikes,it will eat up 6 LSB binary digits in your numbers.
You will have a bunch of numbers,and your machine will have a virus with n spikes,you have to calculate what will be the final situation of the final numbers.

Sample Input
N:5
array V:1 2 3 4 5
Number of Spikes:2
Sample Output: 0 0 0 1 1  (5 = 101 ,removed last two bits for spike = 2)


def removeBit(n,arr):
    ans = []
    for i in arr:
        st = bin(i)[2:-n]
        if(st == ''):
            ans.append(0)
        else :
            ans.append(int(st,2))
    print(ans)
user_input = input("Enter a list (e.g., [1, 'a', 3.5]): ") 
ar = eval(user_input)
n = int(input("Enter spike: "))
removeBit(n,ar)
