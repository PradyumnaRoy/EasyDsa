Problem statement.
The Binary number system only uses two digits, 0 and 1 and the number system can be called binary string. You are required to implement the following function:
int OperationsBinaryString(char* str);
The function accepts a string str as its argument. The string str consists of binary digits separated with an alphabet as follows:
– A denotes AND operation
– B denotes OR operation
– C denotes XOR Operation

You are required to calculate the result of the string str, scanning the string to right taking one operation at a time, and return the same.

Note: No order of priorities of operations is required.
Length of str is odd.
If str is NULL or None (in case of Python), return -1.

Input:
1C0C1C1A0B1

Output:



def np(inp):
    if(len(inp) == 0):
        return -1
    inp = inp.replace("A","&")
    inp = inp.replace("B","|")
    inp = inp.replace("C","^")
    ans = eval(inp)
    return ans

op = input("")
print(np(op))
