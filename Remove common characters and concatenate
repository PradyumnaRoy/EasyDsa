GFG:Given two strings s1 and s2. Modify both the strings such that all the common characters of s1 and s2 are to be removed and the uncommon characters of s1 and s2 are to be concatenated.
Note: If all characters are removed print -1.

Example 1:
Input:
s1 = aacdb
s2 = gafd
Output: cbgf
Explanation: The common characters of s1
and s2 are: a, d. The uncommon characters
of s1 and s2 are c, b, g and f. Thus the
modified string with uncommon characters
concatenated is cbgf.

Example 2:
Input:
s1 = abcs
s2 = cxzca
Output: bsxz
Explanation: The common characters of s1
and s2 are: a,c. The uncommon characters
of s1 and s2 are b,s,x and z. Thus the
modified string with uncommon characters
concatenated is bsxz.


     # Solution 1
 def concatenatedString(self,s1,s2):
        #code here
        new = s1 + s2

        ans = ''

        for ch in new:

            if ch not in s1 or ch not in s2:

                ans += ch

        return ans if ans else -1





       # Solution 2
import copy
class Solution:
    
    #Function to remove common characters and concatenate two strings.
    def concatenatedString(self,s1,s2):
        #code here
        dup = ""
        still = copy.deepcopy(s2)
        for i in s1 :
            if i not in s2:
                dup += i
            else :
                still = still.replace(i,"")
        ans = dup+still                       
        return ans if ans != "" else "-1"
